### Food for Thought
#### Scene Management

- **Three.js Core Components:**  
  Use Three.js’s built‑in Scene, PerspectiveCamera, and WebGLRenderer for a robust, optimized 3D scene graph system.
  
- **dat.GUI & Stats.js:**  
  These libraries are excellent for tweaking scene parameters and monitoring performance during development.

#### Character Animations

- **GLTFLoader & AnimationMixer:**  
  Utilize Three.js’s GLTFLoader to import models (often with built‑in animations) and AnimationMixer to control these animations. Ideal for pre‑animated characters (e.g., from Mixamo).  
- **Mixamo:**  
  Adobe’s Mixamo offers a library of rigged characters and animations exportable in GLTF format, simplifying integration with Three.js.

#### First-Person Controls

- **PointerLockControls:**  
  A built‑in Three.js utility that provides a first‑person camera control scheme with pointer lock—ideal for immersive FPS-style navigation.
  
- **Additional Tweaks:**  
  For more advanced behavior (e.g., custom inertia or collision detection), consider extending PointerLockControls or integrating a physics library like Cannon.js or Ammo.js.
